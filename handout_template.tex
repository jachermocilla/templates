	{\LARGE \textbf{Homework 1: Building ICS-OS}}
\end{center}

\section*{Objectives}
   At the end of this activity, you should be able to:
   \begin{enumerate}
       \item build the ICS-OS kernel and disk image;
       \item run ICS-OS in QEMU and
       \item run two ICS-OS commands.
   \end{enumerate}   

\section{Introduction}
ICS-OS\footnote{https://github.com/srg-ics-uplb/ics-os/} is an instructional (not for production) operating system that can be used for understanding different operating system concepts discussed 
in the lecture. 
An operating system is no different from other software in that it is written in a programming language,  
such as C. Later in the course, you will be modifying portions of the source code of ICS-OS to 
apply and observe various operating system concepts. The tasks  in this homework are from the ICS-OS Kernel Developer's Guide\footnote{https://github.com/srg-ics-uplb/ics-os/wiki/Kernel-Developer's-Guide}.

\section{Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ubuntu 16.04
\end{itemize}   


\section{Deliverables}
Perform the tasks below and capture screen shots while you do them. Submit a PDF file 
containing the screen shots. Do not forget to put your name and laboratory section. (CREDIT: 5 Lecture Quiz Points)


\section{Tasks}

\subsection*{Task 1: Install build dependencies}
A C compiler, assembler, linker, emulator, and other tools are needed to 
build and run ICS-OS.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,frame=single]
$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt-get install build-essential nasm qemu-kvm tcc git gcc-multilib
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Task 2: Clone the repository}
ICS-OS is hosted on Github.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,frame=single] 
$git clone https://github.com/srg-ics-uplb/ics-os.git
$cd ics-os/ics-os
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Task 3: Build}
Building the source code for the kernel and the distribution disk is accomplished using make. Make sure you perform steps 2-4 every time you make changes in the source code.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,frame=single] 
$make clean
$make
$make floppy 
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Task 4: Run}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,frame=single] 
$make run-floppy 
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Task 4: Run ICS-OS commands}
Once the ics-os command prompt appears, type help. 
Examine the list of commands and run two commands.
